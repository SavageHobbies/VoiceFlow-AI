What is PowerShell?
-------------------
PowerShell is a task automation and configuration management framework from Microsoft, consisting of a command-line shell and associated scripting language. 


How to get PowerShell?
----------------------
* **Windows 7 and newer** provide PowerShell by default. However, script execution is **disallowed by default** (execution policy is "restricted"). To enable this, enter in a terminal window as administrator:
   ```
   PS> Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
   ```

How to improve the voice recognition rate?
------------------------------------------
1. Place the microphone right and check the microphone in the sound settings. The loudness should have short spikes up to 100%.
2. Raise the microphone audio level in case a 'low voice' is shown.
3. Use another wake word than 'Windows', e.g. 'Alexa' or 'Siri'.
