---

## üéØ Project Evolution: Towards a More Intelligent Assistant

The WinAssistAI system has evolved beyond predefined commands, now incorporating:

### ‚ú® NEW: Advanced Voice & AI Features

1.  **Conversational AI Integration**
    *   Allows users to ask general questions or give free-form commands to an AI (initially OpenAI GPT models).
    *   Managed by [`scripts/converse-with-ai.ps1`](scripts/converse-with-ai.ps1).
    *   Requires API key configuration in the `.env` file.

2.  **Custom Wake Word Functionality**
    *   Enables voice activation using a user-defined wake word (e.g., "COMPUTER") via a Serenade custom script.
    *   Template provided: [`scripts/serenade_custom_script_template.js`](scripts/serenade_custom_script_template.js).
    *   Detailed setup guide: [`SERENADE_SETUP.md`](SERENADE_SETUP.md).
    *   Improves hands-free experience by preventing unintended command execution.

3.  **ElevenLabs High-Quality TTS**
    *   Integration with ElevenLabs for natural-sounding voice responses.
    *   Now fully configurable via API key in the `.env` file.
    *   Setup managed by [`scripts/setup-elevenlabs.ps1`](scripts/setup-elevenlabs.ps1).

4.  **Centralized `.env` Configuration**
    *   Introduced `.env.example` and expects a user-created `.env` file for managing all external API keys (ElevenLabs, OpenAI) and sensitive configurations like `WAKE_WORD`.
    *   Enhances security and ease of configuration.

### üé§ Continued Serenade Voice Control Integration

*   Existing robust integration with Serenade for executing predefined WinAssistAI scripts remains.
*   The `serenade-bridge.ps1` now also routes non-predefined commands (when wake word is used) to the conversational AI.

### üöÄ Core System Features (Still Strong)

1.  **Extensive Script Library**
    *   792+ predefined PowerShell scripts for system control, application management, information retrieval, etc.
    *   All accessible via direct execution or voice commands.

2.  **Cross-Platform Launchers & Comprehensive Documentation**
    *   `README.md`, `INSTALLATION.md`, `ELEVENLABS_SETUP.md`, and now `SERENADE_SETUP.md` provide extensive guidance.
    *   Launchers for Node.js, Python, Bash, etc., ensure ease of use.

### Command Categories (Primarily for Predefined Voice Commands):
*   Core categories (CHECK, CLOSE, OPEN, etc.) remain unchanged. New scripts `set-ai-provider` and `clear-conversation-history` fall under utility/management.
*   Conversational AI handles queries not matching these predefined commands when wake word is used.

---

## üé§ Voice Control & Text-to-Speech

### ‚úÖ Serenade Voice Control
*   **Voice Input**: Natural language command recognition via Serenade.
*   **Wake Word Activation**: Uses custom Serenade script (`serenade_custom_script_template.js`) for wake word detection (e.g., "COMPUTER"). Requires user setup as per `SERENADE_SETUP.md`.
*   **Command Routing**:
    *   Predefined commands are mapped via `serenade-commands.json` and executed by `serenade-bridge.ps1`.
    *   General queries/unrecognized commands (after wake word) are routed by the custom script and bridge to `converse-with-ai.ps1`.
*   **Auto-Installation**: Serenade app installation is facilitated by WinAssistAI scripts.

### ‚úÖ Text-to-Speech Output
*   **Primary Voice Engine**: ElevenLabs High-Quality AI Voice (if `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` is configured in `.env`). Managed by `setup-elevenlabs.ps1` and used by `say-enhanced.ps1`.
*   **Fallback Voice Engine**: Windows SAPI.SPVoice (built-in). Used if ElevenLabs is not configured or fails.
*   **Coverage**: All system responses and AI replies are spoken.
*   **Error Handling**: Spoken error messages for most scenarios.

**Key TTS Script**: [`scripts/say-enhanced.ps1`](scripts/say-enhanced.ps1) - intelligently chooses between ElevenLabs and Windows SAPI.
```powershell
# Basic TTS
& "$PSScriptRoot/say.ps1" "Hello there!"

# Error handling with TTS
try {
    # Script logic
    & "$PSScriptRoot/say.ps1" "Operation successful."
} catch {
    & "$PSScriptRoot/say.ps1" "Sorry: $($Error[0])"
}

# Random responses
$reply = "Hey!", "Hello!", "Hi there!" | Get-Random
& "$PSScriptRoot/say.ps1" $reply
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **[`say.ps1`](scripts/say.ps1)** - Central TTS engine
   - Uses Windows SAPI.SPVoice COM object
   - Automatic English voice selection
   - Logs output to temp directory

2. **[`open-browser.ps1`](scripts/open-browser.ps1)** - Web integration utility.
3. **[`winassistai.ps1`](scripts/winassistai.ps1)** - Main system interface, help, and command listing.
4. **[`serenade-bridge.ps1`](scripts/serenade-bridge.ps1)** - Handles Serenade commands, now routes to scripts or AI.
5. **[`converse-with-ai.ps1`](scripts/converse-with-ai.ps1)** - Interfaces with configured AI provider (e.g., OpenAI).

### System Requirements Met
*   ‚úÖ Windows 10/11 compatibility.
*   ‚úÖ PowerShell 5.1+ support.
*   ‚úÖ Internet connectivity for API-based features (AI, ElevenLabs, web scripts) and Serenade download.
*   ‚úÖ `.env` file for user-specific API keys and configuration.
*   External Dependencies: Serenade application for voice control. API keys for optional advanced features.

---

## üéØ Key Features Delivered

## üß™ Testing Results

### ‚úÖ Core Functionality Stable
*   Predefined command execution via Serenade and direct script calls remain robust.
*   TTS fallback to Windows SAPI is reliable.

### üü° Advanced Features - User Configuration Dependent
*   **ElevenLabs TTS**: Works if API key in `.env` is valid and `setup-elevenlabs.ps1` is run.
*   **Conversational AI (OpenAI)**: Works if `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `AI_PROVIDER="OpenAI"` are correctly set in `.env`.
*   **Wake Word & AI Routing**: Dependent on user correctly setting up `serenade_custom_script_template.js` as per `SERENADE_SETUP.md` (including correct `WAKE_WORD` sync and absolute paths).

**Conceptual Test Cases for New Features:**
*   **Wake Word + Predefined Command**: `Say: "COMPUTER" ... "check weather"` ‚Üí Executes `check-weather.ps1`.
*   **Wake Word + AI Query**: `Say: "COMPUTER" ... "tell me a story"` ‚Üí Routes to `converse-with-ai.ps1` ‚Üí Responds with AI-generated story.
*   **API Key Handling**: Removing API keys from `.env` should result in graceful fallback or clear spoken error messages (e.g., "OpenAI API key not configured").

### Performance Metrics
*   **Startup Time**: Remains fast; launcher scripts are efficient.
*   **Voice Recognition (Serenade)**: Dependent on Serenade performance.
*   **Predefined Command Execution**: Bridge translation is minimal (<500ms).
*   **AI Query Response Time**: Dependent on AI provider (e.g., OpenAI) API latency and complexity of the query.
*   **TTS Response**: ElevenLabs may have slight network latency for first-time audio generation (caching helps subsequently). Windows SAPI is near-immediate.
