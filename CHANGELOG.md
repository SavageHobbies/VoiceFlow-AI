- **Multi-language Support** (Spanish, French, German)
- **Local AI Models** (Ollama, LM Studio integration)
- **Desktop GUI** (System tray integration, visual feedback)
- **Plugin Architecture** (Custom command plugins)
- **Cross-platform Support** (macOS, Linux)
- **Voice Training** (Custom wake words, voice recognition)
- **Productivity Suite** (Calendar, email, note-taking integration)

### Community Milestones
- 🎯 **Alpha Release**: Core functionality working
- 🚀 **Public Launch**: Open-source repository live
- ⭐ **100 Stars**: Community interest validated
